# Food production in 2050

“We are what we eat”. Indeed, food is everywhere in today’s world, and its impact on our system is huge. Of course we have come a long way since the beginning of humanity when access to food was essential for survival. But yet, the increasingly rapid development of our society brings with it new risks and opportunities, each time challenging our current system. Global warming, the increase in population, the emergence of new countries in globalization, among many others, will all somehow result in a profound change in our food production system.

Of course, the study of our food system is a pretext to recall known events and phenomena as history has had and will have a significant impact on the way we eat. If we take the example of a war, we will find its impact clearly in the food of the time. However, even further on, we believe that research must also be able to reverse this direction of questioning, by showing how food teaches us something about the society that produces and consumes it. The study of food production is then no longer simply used as a proof, but rather as a research tool that truly allows us to learn more about our own society.

In this project, we will try to apply our skills and give insights to tell a story which truly matters. We want to create good visualizations to give our audience a good understanding of the changes that are being brought to light in the models we are given to study, and more importantly, allow to put these changes into perspective with our current society in order to understand the changes and challenges that we will face in the future.

# Map visualization

In this project we tried to carry out a worldwide map visualiztion with prediction scenarios over the 2050.

## The project
This project was done for the Data Visualization course at EPFL.
This specific subject was meant in collaboration with the __Stanford University / Natural Natcaps__.
