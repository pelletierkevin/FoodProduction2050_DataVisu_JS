			Introduction
		</h1>

			<p>
				"We are what we eat”. Indeed, food is everywhere in today’s world, and its impact on our system is huge. Of course we have come a long way since the beginning of humanity when access to food was essential for survival. But yet, the increasingly rapid development of our society brings with it new risks and opportunities, each time challenging our current system. Global warming, the increase in population, the emergence of new countries in globalization, among many others, will all somehow result in a profound change in our food production system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the study of our food system is a pretext to recall known events and phenomena as history has had and will have a significant impact on the way we eat. If we take the example of a war, we will find its impact clearly in the food of the time. However, even further on, we believe that research must also be able to reverse this direction of questioning, by showing how food teaches us something about the society that produces and consumes it. The study of food production is then no longer simply used as a proof, but rather as a research tool that truly allows us to learn more about our own society.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to create good visualizations to give our audience a good understanding of the changes that are being brought to light in the models we are given to study, and more importantly, allow to put these changes into perspective with our current society in order to understand the changes and challenges that we will face in the future. The goal is to leads to feed nearly 10 billion people by 2050 without depleting our planet.

			What can we see ?
		</h1>

			<p>
				Over the past few years, an international team of climate scientists, economists and energy systems modellers have built a range of new “pathways” that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways” (SSPs).
				The SSPs are Climate change projections and socio‐economic scenarios used to evaluate climate impacts and adaptation measures.
				They are stablished by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation (Mitigation is a more development-friendly alternative to strict environmental laws because it allows development to occur where environmental laws might prohibit it).
				<br>
				The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development.
				<br> <br>
				Overview : <br>

				SSP1: low challenges for mitigation (resource efficiency) and adaptation (rapid development)<br>
				SSP3: high challenges for mitigation (regionalized energy / land policies) and adaptation (slow development) <br>
				SSP2: Is in the middle road beat a sustainability and a fossil development. <br>
				SSP4: low challenges for mitigation (global high tech economy), high for adapt. (regional low tech economies) <br>
				SSP5: high challenges for mitigation (resource / fossil fuel intensive) and low for adapt. (rapid development)<br>

					<figcaption class="figure_legend" >Fig.1 - The standards SSPs</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<br>
				But each SSP scenario goes with a spécific model. A model corresponds to a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) which is a greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions). Four pathways have been selected for climate modeling and research, which describe different climate futures, all of which are considered possible depending on how much greenhouse gases are emitted in the years to come.
				<br> 
				The four RCPs, namely RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5, are labelled after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W/m2, respectively). 

				We are not going to dwell more or it because we did the work for you. For each scenario we selected the more relevant RCP to use and data linked with it. We selected only the three more differents models which are : sustainability, inegality and fossil developments.

				
				If you did not get it all, we advise you to go through the visualization. You will be provided we more details for each ssp.

					<p><strong>What are the impacts of the society's behavior on our futur world?</strong></p>
					<p>
						This interactive data story lets you dive in several climate change scenario over the year 2050. 
						<br>From to fossil-fueled to sustainability development, you will be able to see several impact on the food production.
						<br>If you want to know <a href="info.html">more</a> about it or you prefer to go direclty to the <a href="index.html">visualization</a>
					</p>
					<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
					<p>
						On the right side, you can first select which type of development you want by clicking on circles. </br>
						Once selected, you can then select from, three possible parameters, the one to visualize given the model chosen.</br>
						<img src="img/select_model.gif" alt="Select Model Gif" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
						<br>
						Thus you are free to explore the world prediction. First the model will show a heatmap of the selected parameter. Then you will be able to zoom and click on dots to obtain values.
